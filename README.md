🚀 Data-Driven Python Projects
A collection of utility-focused applications built with Python, Pandas, and Streamlit, emphasizing data persistence, logic-based tracking, and specialized data serialization.

📖 Weekly Bible Reading Trackers

**The Problem:** Standard reading plans are passive. **The Solution:** A two-tier tracking system that turns personal habits into quantifiable data.

**Technical Highlights:**

**Data Persistence:** Managed via a CRUD-capable CSV backend.

**Logic-Based Streaks:** Implemented a "Gaps and Islands" algorithm to calculate contiguous reading chains, resetting automatically if a 24-hour window is missed.

**Dashboarding:** Integrated Matplotlib and Streamlit for real-time progress visualization and "Catch-up" analysis for missed entries.
